# sharing is caring (collaboration)
- you must create a 3-5min supercollider work for your partner to perform.
  - no third-party extensions, but you may create your own extension to share directly with your partner (see Sun.sc in the 02.effects week)
- you must perform a partner's work.  
- you will have time in class to collaborate with your partner (30min per class for 3 weeks), but the goal is for you to have such good written documentation by the end of the semester that any SuperCollisionist could play your work.

## Duos/Trios:
- Koyo + Emory
- Fumiya + Althea
- Meeka + Renee
- Gavin + Bryce
- Skylar + Cliff
