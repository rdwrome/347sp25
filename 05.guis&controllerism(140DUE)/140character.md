# 140 character assignment

Using *only* [140 characters](https://wordcounter.net/character-count), make an interesting sound or generative algorithm with SuperCollider. Document your code using the outline below (25% of your grade). Be prepared to present it in class (25% of your grade).

[Use this sc code as a template for your sound or generative algorithm.](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/wiki/SuperCollider_Tweets)

### Steps to submit via GitHub+Canvas
  1. Make a folder in your GitHub private class repository named after the assignment (i.e. {yourusername}/sc/140, etc.)
  2. Commit all parts of your assignment (code+documentation) into the assignment repository folder
  3. Submit the link for the assignment repository folder in Canvas
### Documentation outline
  - always in Markdown as a .md file
  - what you did
  - how you did it
  - the problems you faced (ABDYD: always be documenting your debugging!)
  - how you overcame them
  - *what code you used from others/elsewhere*
      - where to find that code (specific links!!!)
      - Other folks' GitHub public repositories and the [SuperCollider Message Board](https://scsynth.org/) are the best places to go for help most of the time
  - Correctly document all your debugging, especially if you code ultimately does not run as intended. I will take points off for code that does not run correctly, but will still give partial credit if it is well-documented.
  - For the purposes of this class, your documentation also helps you prepare to talk about your code in class with your colleagues.
